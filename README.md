# DSC180A-checkpoint

Code for the baseline models implemented for three tasks across two datasets: NLI on the SNLI dataset, poltical affiliation classification on the LIAR dataset, and veracity prediction on the LIAR dataset. I'll revisit the political affiliation task by adding complexity to my baseline model (and possibly using a different dataset). I'll likely abandon the text-only approach to veracity prediction in favor of an entailment-based approach (hence the experimentation with SNLI), as this seems to be more robust and accurate.
